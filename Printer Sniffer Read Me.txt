Original File Output Path:
The default output path reflects the folder in which the script is currently located. 
You can modify the output location using the GUI.

GUI Server List Editing:
- When you start "Editing" the server list, a new text document is created in the script's current location.
- The script references the data in this text file for ping tests during execution.

Recommended Usage:
- Create a shortcut of the script and place it on your desktop for easy access and to avoid clutter. 

Script Functionality:
- The script operates by sending a ping command to the print spooler of your selected server.
- It subsequently pings all printer devices associated with the server and generates a report.
- The report includes IP addresses, printer names, and their ping status.
