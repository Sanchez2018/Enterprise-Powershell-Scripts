
"Route Tracer Ver 3.1"

Route Tracer Version 3.1 stands out as an indispensable tool in network connectivity diagnosis. 
Unlike a basic "Trace Route" command, it offers specialized features tailored for comprehensive 
analysis within terminal environments.

One of its key distinctions lies in its capability for remote operations within an intranet, 
empowering users with elevated credentials to initiate route tests for specified Host Domain 
names or IPs.

This tool serves as my go-to solution for pinpointing latency issues across afflicted devices. 
By conducting detailed diagnostics, it enables me to discern whether the root causes stem from 
workstations, printers, switches, routers, and beyond.


Instructions:

	> Enter a remote host IP or a workstation name

		-This will cause a query into the DNS and attempt to match the IP / Workstation name 
		 to a Fully Quallified Domain Name (FQDN)

	> Next the script will return it's findings. Either a "failed to resolve" error will appear
	  or the FQDN and Ip address tied to the FQDN will populate.

	> Afterwards, the script will ask for you to input your "Target IP"

		-This will be the host device you want to test the connection with. In my case I often
		 input a networked printer because all networked printers have to go through multiple
		 routers and switches and my users often complain about print latency.

		-This part of the script will run a small and sepperate "Ping" commandlet in the 
		 background in order to check if the target host is even online. (To prevent having to
		 wait for all the hops of the tracert command to complete)

	> If the IP address is active and pingable the script will prompt you for the maximum amount
	  of hops you want it cap out at. I recommend no more than 15, adjust as necesary. 

	> Lastly it will show you the results of your latency test and will ask you if you would like 
	  to continue.
